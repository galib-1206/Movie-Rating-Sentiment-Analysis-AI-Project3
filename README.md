In this project, we aim to analyze and categorize sentiment in IMDb movie reviews, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset consists of a collection of movie reviews, 
providing valuable insights into audience sentiments towards various films. By utilizing deep learning models, specifically Sparse Neural Network (SNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we endeavor to automate sentiment analysis and streamline the process of understanding public opinion about movies.

Project Objectives:
1.Implement sentiment analysis to categorize IMDb movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
2.Train a Sparse Neural Network (SNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sentiment analysis.
3.Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment analysis to compare performance with the LSTM-based model.
4.Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics to determine their effectiveness in sentiment classification.
5.Provide an intuitive comparison between the SNN with LSTM and CNN models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.
